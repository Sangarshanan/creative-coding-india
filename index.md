# About

Welcome to Livecode.BLR! We are a bunch of nerds based out of Bangalore, India. This website is an attempt to consolidate our Meetups/ Jams and to create a **Directory of Creative and Livecoders from India** to help anyone looking for like-minded people to collaborate, build, host events, [algoraves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave) and more <3

Livecode.BLR is a local node of [Algorave India](https://algorave.in/)


# What is Livecoding?

Livecoding is the practice of using computers and programming for artistic expression. While traditional music and visual production processes are effectively opaque, a key component to LiveCoding is transparency, displaying the code and interfaces that produce the sights and sounds in real time. Some guiding principles of our community include: Exposing algorithmic processes, challenging established institutions and hierarchies, collaborative efforts with other communities, equitable practices of diversity and inclusion, and making space for experimentation and failure.
