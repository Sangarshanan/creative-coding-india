# What is Livecoding?

Livecoding is the practice of using computers and programming for artistic expression. While traditional music and visual production processes are effectively opaque, a key component to LiveCoding is transparency, displaying the code and interfaces that produce the sights and sounds in real time. Some guiding principles of our community include: Exposing algorithmic processes, challenging established institutions and hierarchies, collaborative efforts with other communities, equitable practices of diversity and inclusion, and making space for experimentation and failure.
